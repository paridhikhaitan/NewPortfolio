To create a preliminary website\n            for potential investors and users, I tried bringing the vision of\n            the UI/UX Designers to life by creating a Single Page Website using\n            basic HTML and CSS. I also added Google Analytics to this site to\n            get data on the regions and demographic of our potential investors.\n            Using bootstrap studio, we also successfully made the website\n            responsive for Laptops, Tablets and iPhone.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n          </p>\n          <div style={{ display: \"flex\" }}>\n            <img\n              src={require(\"../images/infopost/oldInfo1.png\")}\n              alt=\"Old InfoPost\"\n              style={oldInfo}\n            />\n            <img\n              src={require(\"../images/infopost/oldInfo2.png\")}\n              alt=\"Old InfoPost\"\n              style={oldInfo}\n            />\n          </div>\n          <p>\n            While the old site was running for 4 months, we redesigned our\n            application. In light of this change, I developed a new website,\n            this time using React. Along with this, I worked on the Web\n            Application for InfoPost wherein we used React along with it's\n            several libraries to create the Timeline View, Profile View and\n            Political Information page. Through this experience I was able to\n            get a very hands-on experience with React, as well as see a startup\n            grow from a single person to a team of ten.
