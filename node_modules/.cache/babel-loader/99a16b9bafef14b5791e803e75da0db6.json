We\n                currently have over 200 materials and hope to keep expanding it.\n                This list is sorted based on the subject and updated in real\n                time.\n                <Row justify=\"center\">\n                  <Col md={6} xs={10}>\n                    <img\n                      src={require(\"../images/studybuddy/books.jpg\")}\n                      style={{ border: \"2px solid white\" }}\n                      id=\"communitySplashImage\"\n                      onLoad={() => {\n                        document.getElementById(\n                          \"communitySplashImage\"\n                        ).style.display = \"block\";\n                      }}\n                    />\n                  </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <br />- As it's a peer to peer file sharing platform, we wanted\n                users to help one another and upload their notes! Through our\n                user research, we found that anonymity was important to users.\n                This was also the phase where we went through two versions, and\n                settled on this one. It increased our potential users by 50%.\n                <Row justify=\"center\">\n                  <Col md={6} xs={10}>\n                    <img\n                      src={require(\"../images/studybuddy/upload.jpg\")}\n                      style={{ border: \"2px solid white\" }}\n                      id=\"communitySplashImage\"\n                      onLoad={() => {\n                        document.getElementById(\n                          \"communitySplashImage\"\n                        ).style.display = \"block\";\n                      }}\n                    />\n                  </Col>\n                </Row>\n                <br />- Lastly, to make our platform robust, we wanted to allow\n                users to request resources. Once they did, their peers could\n                seamlessly upload them to our database and it would be available\n                for all UCSD Students.\n              </p>\n              <Row justify=\"center\">\n                <Col md={6} xs={10}>\n                  <img\n                    src={require(\"../images/studybuddy/wishlist.jpg\")}\n                    style={{ border: \"2px solid white\" }}\n                    id=\"communitySplashImage\"\n                    onLoad={() => {\n                      document.getElementById(\n                        \"communitySplashImage\"\n                      ).style.display = \"block\";\n                    }}\n                  />\n                </Col>\n              </Row>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n        </Container>\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default StudyBuddy;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
